## CHARTED - Flexible Funding

This will be used to support the community-driven activities and initiatives that are aligned with CHARTED goals.  It is split into four streams focused on making the skills and training ecosystem easier to navigate and supporting the community growth, across different dRTP roles, including those that are often underrepresented.  

### Fund 1:  FAIR Ecosystem
**Purpose:**  To support activities that make the training ecosystem more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.  These might include defining skills, expanding skill trees, linking skills to training, adapting existing content and identifying missing content and professional development challenges.

**Fund:**  £350k for small projects up to around £5k and a small number of bigger projects up to £100k.

**Timeframe:**  Call expected to open in late 2025/ early 2026, to complete by early 2028.

### Fund 2:  Community Activities
**Purpose:**   To support community-wide activities, mostly at national level.  These may include creation and support of RTP networks, mentoring programmes, events focussed on capturing career profiles, career development and engagement with other stakeholders eg in industry.

**Fund:**   £150k with up to around £5k per event.

**Timeframe:**   Call expected to open around October 2025, to complete by the end of 2028.

### Fund 3:  Tools and Frameworks
**Purpose:**   To support development of new tools and frameworks to improve the navigability of the ecosystem.  Activities might include design, creation or testing of new tools for self-assessment, tools that improve navigation, new approaches to continuous professional development and creation of best practice resources.  Expressions of interest will be collected, and we may consider merging some projects.

**Fund:**  £350k for small projects of up to around £5k, bigger projects up to £150k.

**Timeframe:**   Call expected to open in late 2025/ early 2026, to complete by the end of 2028.

### Fund 4:  Professional Development
**Purpose:**   To support professional development of individuals who may be early in their career, returning after a break or re-orienting themselves in their careers.  Activities may include attending conferences or events, fees for training courses or certificates and visits to other institutions for knowledge exchange.

**Fund:**   £150k with up to around £5k per individual

**Timeframe:**   Call expected to open around October 2025, to complete by the end of 2028.
