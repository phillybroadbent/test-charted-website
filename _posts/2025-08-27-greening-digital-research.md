This series of events is a collaboration between the following projects: CHARTED, NetDRIVE, DisCouRSE and SCALE UP. 

On the path to Net Zero, digital research infrastructure (DRI) must become more sustainable - not only through greener technology but by equipping the people who use, run, and build it with the right skills, awareness and the confidence to act. Research software engineers, data stewards, systems administrators, and other digital Research Technical Professionals (dRTPs) are at the heart of this transition. 

To embed sustainability in their everyday work, we need to understand which “green skills” matter for each role and how best to support them through training, recognition and confidence building. This series of events will try to close the gap between sustainability efforts and the daily work of dRTPs. We want to first understand which “green skills” are relevant to which dRTP roles, and then to understand how best to develop training content that would allow us to truly embed the green principles across all roles in our ecosystem.

The first session will take place at the NetDRIVE Annual Community Meeting. More information can be found here -  [https://eng.ox.ac.uk/netdrive/events/](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/netdrive/events/)
