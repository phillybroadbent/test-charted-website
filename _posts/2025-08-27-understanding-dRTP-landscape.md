This series of events is a collaboration between the following projects: CHARTED, DisCouRSE and SCALE UP. 

There are many national and international efforts focused on defining roles, building skill trees or skill profiles, cataloguing training content and creating learning pathways. The goal of this workshop and event series is to leverage the existing elements of the training landscape to the best possible extent and map the landscape of dRTP skills, roles and training content. Collaborative effort is needed to ensure a comprehensive and consistent set of roles and skills is considered, and the effort within each of the Network Plus projects (including the flexible funds) is as directed and effective as possible.  

Bringing together stakeholders from across the UK and international initiatives will help avoid duplication, foster collaboration, and ensure that each project can focus on its unique contribution to the national picture. By collectively mapping roles to skills and training content, and identifying common gaps, we will be better positioned to support the development of a coherent and comprehensive skills framework. Additionally, the proposed series of workshops would allow members of the wider dRTP community to participate in this process, ensuring a better representation across different roles, career-levels and sectors.

The following events are planned:

-   The skills and competencies session at [RSECon25 Training Community Day](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/training-community-day/) 
-   A session at the DRI congress (Leeds, 21-22 October) 
-   A two day workshop (London, 5-6 November)
-   A session at CIUK (Manchester, 3-5 December)
